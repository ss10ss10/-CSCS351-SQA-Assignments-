## Objective

The objective of the test is the testing of atleast five functions as assigned in this Assignment.

## Test cases, Test coverage, Defects and Platform details.

### Test Cases
- ```Square``` takes one number ```a``` as input and returns the square the number.
- ```Product``` takes two numbers ```a, b``` as input and returns the product of the two numbers.
- ```Quotient``` takes two numbers ```a, b``` as input and returns the quotient of those numbers.
- ```Summ``` takes two numbers ```a, b``` as input and returns find the sum of those numbers.
- ```Difference``` takes two numbers ```a, b``` as input and returns the difference of those numbers.

### Test Coverage
- ```Square``` there are three edge case tests squaring positive numbers, negative numbers and zero.
- ```Product``` there are three edge case tests mulitplying positive numbers, negative numbers and postive and negative numbers.
- ```Quotient```there are three edge case tests dividing positive numbers, negative numbers and postive and negative numbers.
- ```Summ```there are three edge case tests adding positive numbers, negative numbers and postive and negative numbers.
- ```Difference```there are three edge case tests subtracting positive numbers, negative nubers and postive and negative numbers.

## Defects

There were no defects found during the testing of any of the functions.

## Platform and test environment details

```PyUnit``` is used and the the code is written in ```Python3```. Only the  ```task1TestSuite.py``` code file has to be run. It offers multiple options to run specific unit tests or the entire testing suite at the same time.
