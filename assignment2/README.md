## Objective

The objective of this task is to demonstrate API testing using ```Selenium``` for ```Python```.

### Dependencies
- ```selenium``` install selenium using "pip install selenium"
- ```chromedriver``` chromedriver executable needs to be in the current working directory where the python script is

### Test Cases
- ```get``` opens an instance of the provided URL (in this case 'google.com')
- ```find_element``` finds the search box by class_name
- ```send_keys``` puts the string to be searched (in this case 'selenium') in the search box
- ```submit``` sends the query back to the server which displays the result in the chromedriver instance we opened previously
- ```find_elements``` finds the first few search results and gets their urls and displays them to the console
- ```close``` closes the chromedriver instance that carried all of these tasks out
