## Objective

The objective of this task is to demonstrate API testing using ```Selenium``` for ```Python```.

### Test Cases
- ```get``` opens an instance of the provided URL (in this case 'google.com').
- ```find_element``` finds the search box by class_name.
- ```send_keys``` puts the string to be searched (in this case 'selenium') in the search box.
- ```submit``` sends the query back to the server which displays the result in the chromedriver instance we opened previously.
